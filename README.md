# cprj
A simple project generation tool.

## Getting Started
* ### Prerequisites
  A working Cargo and Rust installation as well as ```gcc``` and ```make``` to execute the projects generated by cprj:

  ### Arch
  ```shell
  pacman -S --needed base-devel rustup
  rustup toolchain install stable
  rustup default stable
  ```

* ### Installing:
  clone the repo and cd into it,
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/PortableNavi/cprj
  cd cprj
  ```
  then build the binary and copy it into a suitable location (e.g. ```/usr/bin/```)
  > Note: To copy to ```/usr/bin``` you most likely need sudo privileges
  ```shell
  cargo build --release
  cp target/release/cprj /usr/bin/cprj
  ```

  As of now, you also need to create the config and data directory manually. Just copy their skeletons into the correct locations:
  ```shell
  cp -r setup/data/cprj ~/.local/share/cprj
  cp -r setup/config/cprj ~/.config/cprj
  ```

  That's it, you're done :)
  
* ### Basic Usage
  To see a list of all available project templates, use:
  ```shell
  cprj list_templates
  ```
  
  Create a new Project called TestProject based on a template called "Empty":
  ```shell
  cprj new --template=Empty TestProject
  ```
  This will create a new folder called TestProject with the project inside it.
  To change the name or configuration, edit its settings file located inside the project folder
  at ```.cprj/settings.toml```. I recommend editing the name and version to match your naming and versioning conventions.

  > Note: ```.cprj/``` is a hidden directory. Enable your file explorers settings to show hidden files if you cannot see it

  To run or build your project, use these commands at the root of your project:
  ```shell
  cprj run
  cprj build
  ```
  > Note: ```cprj run``` will build AND run your project. No need to do ```cprj build && cprj run``` manually
